About the OPNids plugins
==========================

The plugins collection offers users and developers a way to quickly
build additions for OPNids that can be optionally installed.  As
soon as they are upstreamed they will become available to everyone
through the firmware GUI pages.

Plugins can do the following:

* Modify the menu, access control lists and look and feel (themes)
* Add additional server software and their respective GUI pages
* Create new authentication methods to be used within other subsystems
* Provide other types of devices and interfaces to the firewall
* Pull in additional packages that will update automatically
* Enhance the backend services with additional work tasks
* Allow custom start, stop and early scripts
* Persistent /boot/loader.conf modifications
* Additional themes for the web GUI


Stay safe,
Your OPNids team
